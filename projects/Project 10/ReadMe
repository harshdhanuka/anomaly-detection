Assignment 10  -  LOAN DEFAULT DETECTION  -  GLM, Generalized Linear Model, with Balanced Classes, Regularization, without Regularization, 
and AUTO ML, AML - Supervised Learning


In this Module you will build (1) the GLM model and (2) the  autoML with the mortgage probability of default data.

The criteria include ROC and the cumulative Lift. 
Make sure you read the H2O documentation for the hyper-parameters to test accordingly. 
You also can select or drop the variables to improve the model performance.

In your video presentation you only need to present the final set of hyper-parameters that deliver the best outcome.
