Assignment 7  -  LOAN DEFAULT DETECTION  -  Random Forest, RF using H2O, Under Sampling, Over Sampling - Supervised Learning

Performed Random Forest Modelling on the Loan Default Dataset, to identify likeliness of the loan defaults.


In this Module you will build:

- the RF model and
- experiment at least two sampling methods with the mortgage probability of default data.

The criteria include ROC and the cumulative Lift. 

Make sure you read the H2O documentation for the hyper-parameters to test accordingly. You also can select or drop the variables to improve the model performance.

In your video presentation you only need to present the final set of hyper-parameters that deliver the best outcome.
