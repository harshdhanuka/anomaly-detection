Assignment 9  -  LOAN DEFAULT DETECTION  -  GMB, Gradient Boosting using H2O, and DEEP LEARNING - Supervised Learning

Performed GBM Modelling, and Deep Learing on the Loan Default Dataset, to identify likeliness of the loan defaults.


In this Module you will build (1) the GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) model and (2) the Deep Learning with the mortgage probability of default data.

The criteria include ROC and the cumulative Lift. 
Make sure you read the H2O documentation for the hyper-parameters to test accordingly. 
You also can select or drop the variables to improve the model performance.

If your model training time is long, consider use a small percentage of random samples of the data to build your model.

In your video presentation you only need to present the final set of hyper-parameters that deliver the best outcome.
