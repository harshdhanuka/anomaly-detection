Assignment 4  -  HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY INSURANCE CLAIM FRAUD

EDA for a dataset on HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY INSURANCE CLAIMS, to later predict fraud in claims.



There are two tasks: (a) paper reading and (b) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In (a), you will read the assigned article and write a short summary of your takeaways. The takeaways are ideas that you will do in the EDA or in future analysis. 

In (b), you will conduct an exhaustive Exploratory Data Analysis on the provided dataset. You will create new features and structure your EDA for different leads with sub-sections. Write a short summary of the features that you built and insight that they afforded at the end of each sub-section. Please submit in the HTML format.  

Lead: Write about what you are going to do in two to three sentences.

Analysis: your EDA
- Conclusion: What is business insight? How can this feature help prediction?
- R code used
- An important aspect of this course is to acquire hands-on coding skills. 

I have written several articles on Data Visualization to assist you. 
In the article "Use Seaborn to Do Beautiful Plots Easy (Links to an external site.)", 
I said quite often in your EDA you need to show:

- the distribution of X, and
- the distribution of Y by another categorical variable X, and
- the interactions of two or three variables.

So apply the code to your analysis.
